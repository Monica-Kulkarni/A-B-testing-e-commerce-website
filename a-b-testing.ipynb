Both A/B testing and logistic regression were employed to answer the same question.\n\n(1) In A/B testing, I performed a one-sided hypothesis testing: whether new page leads to more conversion rate. The null is new page is not better than old page. The alternative is new page is better. The resulted p value from my test is 0.9, therefore I failed to reject null, and conclude that **new page is not better in leading to conversion**.\n\n(2) In the logistic regression method, I intend to prove that conversion rate depends on landing page, therefore it is a two-sided hypothesis test. The null is there is no difference between the conversion rate of old and new page. The alternative is there is a difference. The resulted p value from my test is close to 0.2, therefore I failed to reject null, and conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in conversion rate between old and new landing_page. \n\n(3) Beside landing_page, I also tested whether country matters in conversion rate. I didn't find any statistically significant evidence that country matters. In other words, **country does not matter**.\n\n(4) I also tried to find out whether day of week matters. When considering all 7 days of weeks, I didn't find statistically significant evidence to support that a specific day of week has better conversion rate. But when comparing Monday and Friday, I did find that **Monday conversion rate is statistically better than Friday**. \n\n(5) I then tried to find out whether running the test longer time improves conversion rate. Neither old_page nor new_page conversion rate improved with time. From the linear regression of p_new-p_old against day, the R-square=0, and p value is close to 1. Therefore is not any indication that running the test longer will improve test results, and I **DO NOT** suggest running longer time.
