My goal for this project was to perform A/B testing on a product, here being the interface of an e-commerce website.
Here, I've used a database providing details on the conversion rate of two groups(treatment group that holds the new interface and 
control group that holds the old interface), on an e-commerce platform from 1st to 24th January, 2017.
The aim was to decide whether the e-commerce website should keep the old interface or change it to the new one.
